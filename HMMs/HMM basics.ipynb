    "This problem is a limitation of first-order hidden Markov models, since first-order HMMs cannot model **long-term dependencies**. \n",

    "To fix this problem, one solution is to **increase the dependency order**, e.g., to make the state at step t to depend on all states from 1 to t - 1, rather than just t - 1. We will stop here.
