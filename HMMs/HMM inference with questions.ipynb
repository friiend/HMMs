    "\n",
    "Before diving into the details of the inference algorithms, we present some background on numerics. In brief, computers are more accurate when computing \"good numbers\" (not too small or too large in magnitude, say 5, 10, 100) than \"bad numbers\" (too small in magnitude like $10^{-10}$ or too large like $10^{10}$, try adding these two numbers in python yourself and see the result, also see how computers [represent floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format#IEEE_754_single-precision_binary_floating-point_format:_binary32)). To retain sufficient numerical precision we would prefer that all our inference algorithms worked with \"good numbers\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Directly working with the raw probabilities may result in very small numbers. Consider a simple Markov chain transitioning 10 steps with each step having a transition probability of 0.1. Then, the probability for the full chain is $0.1^{10}$, which is a very small number, in fact, too small for computers to operate on accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we need to find a smarter way to represent this number. We do so by transforming it into the log-probability domain (natural logarithm) and perform any subsequent operations in the log domain only, e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\log 0.1^{10} = 10 \\log 0.1 = -23.0258 \\ldots$\n",
